                      ðŸ‘‹ About Me
      
      Iâ€™m a passionate Data Scientist and AI/ML Engineer with hands-on experience in Deep Learning, software engineering, and data-driven problem solving. 
      I specialize in transforming raw data into intelligent systems that power insights, automation, and innovation.
      I enjoy bridging the gap between data and intelligent systemsâ€”whether itâ€™s model development, AI integration, or end-to-end product pipelines.
      Always exploring, always building .
